        "[^1] We jumpstarted our ideas off of an article relating low intelligence and the prevelance of hookworm infections in the Southern United States region. [^2] Subsequent studies reinforced this link between decline of cognitive ability and hookworm infections. This led us to think about the relationship between parasitic organisms - which are generally more common in regions with poor sanitation - and the behavior of the general public. Since \"intelligence\" doesn't have an objective and definitive measure, we decided to use crime rate data, which is usually available from governmental bodies. Additionally, hookworm infections are too specific of a disease to be considered representative of cognitive function affecting parasites, so we decided to look at the more standardized measure of sanitation instead.\n",

Looking at the study we can see that GIP(growth-inequality-poverty) was used to understand the premise of crime rate. Compared to this study, our group takes a closer look at sanitation as it pertains to quality of life and expands on poverty.\n",
